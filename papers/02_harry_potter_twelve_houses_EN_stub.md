## **I. Introduction:  Contemporary Myth and Astrological Archetypes**

Jung once said: *“Myths are the language of the collective unconscious of humankind.”*
J. K. Rowling’s *Harry Potter* series is undoubtedly the most influential contemporary mythic text of the twenty-first century.

If we take Campbell’s “Hero’s Journey” as the archetypal framework, Harry’s process of growth—from orphan to hero, from “the Chosen One” to the self-sacrificing redeemer—almost completely reenacts the cycle of **“Call → Trial → Death → Rebirth → Return.”**
This process can be correlated one-by-one with the structure of the Twelve Houses in astrology.

*Harry Potter* is not merely a fantasy novel; it is a **modern parable of consciousness traveling through the twelve houses.**

This paper, through a method of symbolic analysis, will demonstrate
how Harry’s psychological and spiritual journey across the seven books corresponds to the twelve-house sequence,
and why this structure continues to evoke collective emotional resonance in the modern era.

## **II. Theoretical Background:  From Archetype to Narrative Structure**

**Campbell (1949)** — The Hero’s Journey model provides the structural reference for this paper.
**Jung (1959)** — Archetypal psychology offers the psychological foundation for symbolic analysis.
**Liz Greene (1984)** and **Howard Sasportas (1984)** — Their theory of house psychology forms the astrological language framework of this study.

Harry’s story is interpreted as **the soul’s passage through the twelve houses**, each house corresponding to a central psychological theme in his life:
from the awakening of self-consciousness (First House),
to the confrontation with power and death (Eighth House),
and finally to the integration of the soul (Twelfth House).

## **IV. Symbolic Analysis and Psychological Dimensions**

### (1) Death and Rebirth – The Core Archetype of the Eighth House

Voldemort represents the “shadow side” of the Eighth House—control, fear, power, and the obsession with immortality.
Harry embodies “the integration of the shadow”: he dissolves control through sacrifice and conquers fear through trust.
Together they form the dual symbol of *death and rebirth*, the transformative axis of the entire twelve-house journey.

### (2) Faith and Meaning – The Philosophical Awakening of the Ninth House

During the search for the Horcruxes, Harry begins to question fate and free will.
This is the classic Ninth-House theme—the self-construction of a belief system.
He learns to think independently and understands that “magic” is not merely power but a vessel of meaning.

### (3) Integration of the Twelfth House – Return of the Soul

In the King’s Cross scene, Harry’s conversation with Dumbledore symbolizes the integration of consciousness.
Death is no longer fear, but a peace that returns to the whole.
This corresponds precisely to the Twelfth House symbolism: surrender, integration, completion.

## **V. Discussion:  Why Harry Potter Became a Modern Collective Myth**

### 1. A Complete Archetypal Cycle

*Harry Potter* re-enacts the psychological wholeness of the Twelve Houses:
from individual to collective, from action to sacrifice, from self to soul.
This structure fulfills the modern human yearning for the archetypal triad of **meaning – growth – redemption**.

### 2. Universality on the Natal-Chart Level

Every reader can project themselves into different stages of Harry’s path:

* Adolescents resonate with the learning and self-expression of the Third and Fifth Houses;
* Adults resonate with the responsibility and sacrifice of the Eighth and Tenth Houses;
* Spiritual seekers resonate with the transcendence and serenity of the Twelfth House.

### 3. Manifestation of the Collective Unconscious

The global popularity of *Harry Potter* arises not only from narrative charm but from its activation of the **shared hero archetype** in humanity.
This is also why the Twelve Houses remain timeless: they are the **cosmic projection of the psyche’s structure.**

## **VI. Conclusion:  The Astrological Heart of a Modern Myth**

On the surface, the *Harry Potter* series speaks of magic; in essence, it speaks of the **alchemy of consciousness.**
Harry’s journey mirrors the spiritual map of the Twelve Houses:

the awakening of the First, the testing of the Second, the learning of the Third,
all the way to the wholeness of the Twelfth.

In this process, every house is a stage of the soul, and every battle a step in the growth of consciousness.
As Campbell said:

> *“The hero’s return is meant to tell us that every person is on their own journey.”*

When we read *Harry Potter*, we are also remembering our own birth chart:
starting from the Ascendant’s First House, passing through fear and love,
until, in the Twelfth House, we find that peace which transcends destiny.
